## Languages and Linguistics

I am interested in linguistic studies including, but not limited to, human languages. 

Regarding human languages, I am particularly interested, for example in the distinctions between dialects and languages, and in the ways genetic testing and linguistics can be used to trace human migration. Personally, I speak English and French fluently, and am proficient in Spanish and Italian. I have studied, but am not conversational in, German,  Russian, Chinese, Yoruba and Egyptian heiroglyphics. 

I speak Python and R with ease, and am proficient in Haskell and JavaScript. I have programmed in Perl, and have a working knowledge of Rust. Linguistically, I am interested in functional programming versus imperative programming, and in the linguistic borrowings between languages, Python's increasing inclusion of functional paradigms being an example.

I am also interested in non-linguistic fields which have strong linguistic aspects. In particular, as a former professor of Chinese Herbal Medicine, I think that a didactic approach which recognizes the linguistic aspects of the field would be beneficial. I'm writing about it [here](../posts/chinese-medicine/chinese-herbal-language/index.qmd)
