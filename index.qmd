# Welcome to my workshop

Here you will find articles about things that interest me. Much of the site is devoted to technological topics such as Linux, programming, and data science. There is a "humanities" section as well where I post on a range of topics such as history, linguistics, Chinese medicine, gardening and cooking, and music.

For those returning, this third iteration of my website now allows you to comment on posts, so I look forward to your feedback and ideas. You can still email me as before, of course.

Here you will find articles about [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
