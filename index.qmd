# biscotty's Workshop

> For the love of learning

### Welcome

Here you will find articles about things that interest me. Much of the site is devoted to technological topics such as Linux, programming, and data science. There is a "humanities" section as well where I post on a range of topics such as history, linguistics, Chinese medicine, gardening and cooking, and music.

If this is your first time, check out the all the posts [here](https://biscotty.online/blogs/blogs.html).

### What's new

For those returning, this third iteration of my website is built in Quatro. I hope you like the new layout. It now allows you to comment on posts, so I look forward to your feedback and ideas. You can still email me as before, of course. Thanks to Samantha Shanny-Csik [@shanny-csik_creating_2022; @shanny-csik2022] and Albert Rapp [@rapp_ultimate_2022].
