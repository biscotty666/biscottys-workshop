# biscotty's Workshop

> For the love of learning

## Welcome

Here you will find articles about things that interest me. Much of the site is devoted to technological topics such as Linux, programming, and data science. There is a "humanities" section as well where I post on a range of topics such as history, linguistics, Chinese medicine, gardening and cooking, and music.


If this is your first time, check out the all the posts [here](posts/posts.qmd), or use the search icon in the upper left.

### Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is *Personal Knowledge Management* [PKM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) software. If you don't know what Obsidian or PKM are, you could start with [this article](posts/obsidian/optimal-notes-with-obsidian/index.qmd). I have many articles here about advanced usage, taking full advantage of Obsidian's design. [Freeing your thinking](posts/obsidian/freeing-your-thinking.qmd) explains how to move beyond directory structures, taking advantage of the [no-sql](posts/obsidian/obsidian-no-sql-database/index.qmd) nature of Obsidian. There is also a series about the usage of [dataviewjs](posts/obsidian/dataview.qmd), written for non-programmers, to create dashboards and interactive tables.

### Data Science

My current passion is data science, with particular interest in geospatial analyses (GIS). I enjoy working both in both [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/). Some of articles will explicitly compare the two, as I think that data science Python programmers would find R delightful, such as showing how to do [gps trail mapping](posts/data-science/python-gpx-mapping.qmd) in R instead of Python.

### Linux

I've used [Linux](https://www.linux.org/) almost exclusively for over three decades. The first 20 years or so I used [Slackware](http://www.slackware.com/), the oldest distribution still being developed. Since then I have extensively used [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/), both mutable and immutable versions, as well as [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) and [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/). 

My current OS of choice is [NixOS](https://nixos.org/), which is unlike any other [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) I'm aware of, and very different conceptually. To get an idea of what I mean, read [The Linux Different](posts/linux/nixos-linux-different/).


### Chinese Medicine

I am a retired Doctor of Oriental Medicine, which I practiced for nearly two decades as well as teaching at Southwest Acupuncture College where I specialized in Chinese herbal medicine, medical theory, and diagnosis. I see Chinese herbs all around me when I walk, not to mention those growing in my own yard. Some of these articles will describe the health properties, from a Chinese perspective, of everyday plants.

I also love to cook, and tried to stress food therapy to my patients as a key aspect of healing. Keeping a proper diet is the most important thing that anyone can do for their health. So I will occasionally post recipes, pointing out the health aspects of the meals.

### About me

I have a background ranging from international finance and administration, programming, software translation and localization management. I've been a medical doctor, business owner and professor. You can find out more about me, my current work, and services [here](about.qmd)

### What's new

For those returning, this third iteration of my website is built in Quatro. I hope you like the new layout. It now allows you to comment on posts, so I look forward to your feedback and ideas. You can still email me as before, of course. Thanks to Samantha Shanny-Csik [@shanny-csik_creating_2022; @shanny-csik2022] and Albert Rapp [@rapp_ultimate_2022].
