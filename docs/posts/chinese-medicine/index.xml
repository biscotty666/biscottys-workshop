  <description><![CDATA[ The <em>Huáng dì nèi jīng</em> (黃帝內經) is the oldest extant Chinese medical text, and before addressing disease and its treatment, it discusses disease prevention: how to stay healthy. In fact, it states that those who maintain an appropriate diet and activity level, together with rest and relaxation, should rarely fall ill, and quickly recover when they do, with moderation necessary in all things. This seem somewhat obvious, but the <em>nèi jīng</em> adds, and emphasizes, another element, which may seem strange to Westerners: everything should be done in accordance with the season. ]]></description>
