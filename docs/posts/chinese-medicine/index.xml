  <title>Eating in spring</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ The <em>Huáng dì nèi jīng</em> (黃帝內經) is the oldest extant Chinese medical text, dated to around the 2<sup>nd</sup> century B.C.E. It lays out the foundational concepts on which all Chinese medicine is based. Before addressing disease, pathology and treatment, it discusses disease <em>prevention</em>: how to stay healthy. In fact, it posits that those who maintain an appropriate diet and activity level, together with rest and relaxation, with moderation in all things, should rarely fall ill, and quickly recover when they do. The elements of this advice are hardly surprising, but the <em>nèi jīng</em> does add, and emphasizes, an element, which may seem strange to Westerners: everything should be done in accordance with the season. ]]></description>
