If you've ever been to a good Japanese or Korean shusi restaurant in the United States, you know that the raw fish is inevitably served with sliced ginger and whole green, or sometimes purple, leaves.[^3] Shiso leaves have a strong and complex flavor, and together with ginger allow you to "cleanse your palette" between slices of fish. But, did you ever realize that the ginger and the shiso provide more than just flavor, but are actually medicinal substances in the Chinese pharmacopia, with medical properties specifically related to seafood?

[^3]: Cheap restaurants will often put a little piece of jagged green plastic, resembling a leaf, kind of, to stand in for the shiso leaf.

This plant has several fascinating and even unique functions, some of which elucidate some of the "stranger" concepts of CM. In this article, I will explore the medicinal properties of Perilla (shiso).

## Seafood Toxicity

Perilla leaves have a unique, specific function. It is the only herb that *relieves seafood toxicity*. There are quite a few herbs which relieve toxicity, but none other is specific to seafood. The most important herb to relieve toxicity generally is *fresh ginger*, which is commonly used to reduce the toxicity of other medical substances. Clinically, they are almost always used in combination to treat food poisoning from eating bad fish or shellfish. Using them together follows the herbologic principle that one plus one sometimes equals three. Certain herbal combinations are recognized as not only complementing each others functions, but potentiating them, making their effects stronger than they would be if used alone. Culinarily these two are also frequently used together, and good cooks recognize that the one plus one equals three principle applies in their domain as well.

Shiso is perilla in English and Latin, and *zǐ sū* (紫蘇) in Chinese. *Zĭ* 紫 means purple, the original color of the plant, green varieties being more recently developed for culinary purposes. *Sū* 蘇 means "revive". This can mean bringing someone or something back to life, and medically refers to restoring consciousness to a patient. It also refers to "waking up" the digestive system, as we'll see.

The plant is generally warming and pungent, and affects the respiratory and digestive systems. In Chinese medicine, this involves the *Lung and Spleen Systems*^[The Spleen in Chinese medicine corresponds more closely to the Pancreas in terms of physiological function], with their paired organs, the Large Intestines and Stomach. These are the organs which are responsible for providing the body with energy (*qì* 氣) and all the physical resources required for daily living. Food is processed in the Spleen/Stomach with oxygen provided by the Lungs, with the waste being eliminated by the Large Intestine.

The earliest references to *zĭ sū yè* date back to the 5$th$ century C.E. The leaves have a strong and complex, minty, peppery flavor, mixed with hints of cinnamon. It is a member of the mint family. In addition to being pungent, the leaves are aromatic, with many volatile, essential oils. In the *Materia Medica*, they are grouped with the many herbs used to treat colds and flu in patients with chills and no sweating. Internally, it focuses on the abdomen and digestion. It is the other functions and indications which make the herb so interesting, though. In addition to relieving seafood toxicity, which we already discussesd, the leaves can  *calm the fetus*. I look at this fascinating concept below.

Perilla stems are less commonly used clinically. They do share some of the properties and functions of the leaves, albeit with weaker effect.

The seeds are focused on the lungs and large intestines. The close connection between these two organs is rather mysterious at first glance, but fundamental to the Chinese system, as I will explain later. The seeds, as is true with many seeds, are considered to have a downward movement. (Directionality is another of the many ways herbs are classified.) This downward movement means that it can drain the congestion from the lungs and/or alleviate constipation.


## Calming fetuses

Among the many functions attributed to herbs in Chinese Medicine, one seems somewhat peculiar: herbs that calm the fetus. Herbs with this function have two main uses, to treat pregnancy-related concerns in the mother, and to protect the developing fetus from the negative impacts of herbs intended to treat the mother.

In the latter case, it is common practice among gynecologists, or any doctors treating pregnant women, to include a small amount of an herb to protect the fetus from any side effects of the herbs administered to the mother. The idea of *calming the fetus* in this context is communicating to the fetus that the other herbs are not intended for the fetus.

The former case is somewhat more interesting. From the perspective of the mother's body, the fetus is a source of stagnation in the body, specifically stagnation of phlegm, *qi*, and blood. In an uncomplicated pregnancy, especially if the woman has no pre-existing health conditions, a woman's body is able to respond and process this stagnation.

Morning sickness is an example of the stagnation of phlegm caused by the fetus, in this case manifesting in the stomach. The stagnation of phlegm in the stomach, caused by the fetus, results in nausea and vomiting, as the *qi* of the stomach is unable to *descend* normally into the intestines. This results in a condition with the colorful name of *rebellious qi*.

## "Wake up, Spleen!"

> Harnessing the sense of smell

Phlegm is one of the pathogens described in Chinese medicine. It is probably the most difficult to understand for students and the most difficult to treat for the practitioner. Phlegm includes the stuff you cough out of your lungs, which is called *visible phlegm*, but also includes *invisible phlegm*, which can bring internal systems to a halt. Phlegm is most closely related to another pathogen, dampness, but many doctors consider phlegm to be a component of all chronic disease. In extreme cases, when phlegm affects the *Heart System* it can lead to loss of consciousness. When if affects the Lung and Spleen, it can cause severe chest and abdominal congestion and pain, and disorders such as COPD^[[Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease)].

Phlegm, especially severe cases, are treated with *aromatic* substances.
This is a special *flavor*, not one of the standard five.[^4] Aromatic herbs act through the sense of smell, and these herbs typically contain large amounts of volatile oils. Most people are familiar with using smelling salts to revive consciousness. Smelling salts are ammonium compounds. In CM, we use musk and several plant resins for the same purposes.

The Spleen/Stomach are the center of the body, and responsible for the upward and downward motion of the body. The downward movement ensures that food and drink move smoothly through the GI tract to the point of elimination. The upward movement sends the nourishment, *qì* and blood in CM terms, up to the Lungs and Heart respectively, from where they are distributed throughout the body.

## Clearing the Lungs

> The three seeds

Perilla seeds are used for two conditions, with a connection that illustrates a fascinating aspect of the traditional Chinese understanding of human physiology. Zi su zi treats both lung congestion and constipation. This seems somewhat random, but from a Chinese Medicine perspective, the conjunction of these two functions in a single substance is very natural.

First, regarding the Lungs, the seeds are used to treat such conditions as asthma, COPD, or certain types of flu. Chinese herbology is all about combinations. Herbs are not used singly, but together with others, often in specific pairs or triplets of herbs. To treat lung conditions, perilla seed is combined with radish seeds (lai fu zi) and mustard seeds (bai jie zi).

## The Large Intestine

> The end of the tale

Zi su zi is also used to treat constipation. Its high oil content makes it useful to treat constipation with dry stool, a condition common in the elderly. It is usually combined with other high-fat seeds for this purpose, in particular cannabis seeds (huo ma ren), the principle medicinal substance in the Materia Medica for this condition.

In Chinese Medicine, there is a concept of paired organs. In Chinese philosphy, all things ineveitably have *yin* aspects and *yang* aspects, and the organ system is no exception. The five organ systems in CM are actually composed of pairs of organs. Some are obvious, like the Liver (*yin*) being paired with the Gall Bladder (*yang*), or the Kidney (*yin*) paired with the Urinary Bladder (*yang*). Others are strange, such as the pairing of the Lung, a *yin* organ, with the Large Intestines, a *yang* organ.

In CM, the Spleen (Pancreas) and Stomach are responsible for processing food, but this processing requires oxygen, supplied the Lungs. They work together to provide the daily nourishment required by our bodies, and so in this sense, elimination by the large intestines makes sense as a part of the overall process.

There is also a *spiritual* aspect of the Lung/Large Intestines. When one is born, and takes the first breath, the *po* enters the body. The *po* can be
