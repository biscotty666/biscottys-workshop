When I taught Chinese Materia Medica, a course in which students learn all of the properties of over 1,000 medicinal substances, one of the challenges was to make the subject more tangible beyond the pages of the texts. Many plants commonly used in Chinese Medicine (CM) grow all around us, sometimes in our own back yard. My students had a regular assignment to identify and report on such herbs which they identify around town. Making connections with plants they see every day helped them to memorize their properties.

A perennial favorite was the mulberry tree, and for good reason. The mulberry tree originated in China, but spread throughout the globe, and is now considered an invasive species in many areas. It is a tree of tremendous historical importance, as it is the host of the silkworm. Silk production in China was so important that the primary inter-continental trade route for 1,500 years, up until the mid-15^th^ century: the [Silk Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road).

This silkworm itself provides two medicinal substances, but the mulberry tree provides no less than five. It is not unusual for us to use different parts of a plant for different purposes, but such a range is unique. Depending on the part of the tree used, it may work on acute conditions like colds and flu, or chronic conditions like arthritis. It may work on the most superficial levels of the body, or the deepest levels. Some are used to address psychological/emotional issues, others explicitly physical. Some are nourishing, others are "dispersing"[^3].

[^3]: dispersing refers to eliminating pathogens

In this article, I will explore the variety of uses of the different parts of the tree. This does not constitute medical advice, and use of any herb should be approached with caution. Even those which are not toxic (none of these are) can produce unwanted side effects and be harmful to your health. Doctors of Chinese Medicine spend years of study before prescribing, for good reason.

## The tree

I should specify that I am discussing the white mulberry. Despite the wide range of functions and indications attributed to the various parts, we can, never-the-less, identify some commonalities. CM classifies pharmacuticals in various ways including their nature[^4], flavor[^5], part(s) of the body affected, and pathogenic influences[^6].

[^4]: hot, warm, neutral, cool, cold

[^5]: sour, sweet, salty, bitter, pungent

[^6]: heat, cold, damp, phlegm, wind, etc.

The mulberry tree is cold in nature. All plants are placed on a spectrum from hot to cold, which is an indication of its ability to either increase or reduce body temperature. It primarily affects the *Lung System*[^7] and the *Liver System*[^8]. Most are bitter or pungent, flavors associated with clearing and dispersing pathogenic influences, and among these, the mulberry targets wind, dampness and phlegm.

[^7]: The Lung System includes much of the immune system. It controls the *exterior* of the body, and is responsible for resisting external pathogens which result in, eg. colds and flu.

[^8]: The Liver System includes the muscles and joints. It plays an important role in emotional regulation, and poor function can result in irritability, anger, depression and poor sleep.

## The leaves

:::

Mulberry leaves are one of the most commonly used herbs to treat certain types of cough: those associated with summertime colds and flu, and those with a lot of phlegm in the lungs. In CM, the *Lung System* controls the skin as well as the lungs themselves, and is responsible for temperature regulation. It is our primary defense against all airborne pathogens, including viruses and bacteria. *Sāng yè* is one of the main ingredients[^9] in the classical formula *sāng yè tāng*, which exemplifies the treatment of colds occurring in warm weather.

[^9]: the other being chrysanthemum flowers

Among other things, the *Liver System* is responsible for vision and the eyes. The mulberry leaves are important in treating red, swollen eyes. Interestingly, in both these applications, *sāng yè* is most often combined with chrysanthemum flowers[^10]. In Chinese medicine, herbs are (almost) always used in combinations, and certain pairings are recognized as particularly useful.

## The fruit

While the leaves affect the most superficial parts of the body, the fruit affects some of the deepest levels. Unlike the others, the fruit has no affect on the Lungs, but does strongly affect the Liver[^13]. While the other parts of the tree are primarily used to treat pathogens, the fruit is nourishing. More specifically, it nourishes the blood. The Chinese concept of blood is more expansive than the western definition, and "insufficiency of blood" is often the root not only of anemia but also of insomnia, depression, and other emotional disorders. Physical manifestations include hypotension, dizziness, and tinnitus. The mulberry fruit is also used in the treatment of diabetes.

## The twigs

:::

If the pathogenic forces of wind, dampness and heat make it through the superficial levels of the body, they enter the joints, limbs, and what Chinese medicine refers to as the "sinews"^[This includes the tendons and ligaments]. This can lead to symptoms such as swelling, pain, numbness, or even paralysis. Where the mulberry leaves focus on the superficial layers, the twig or branch penetrates deeper as well, expelling the pathogenic forces from those areas. This is 100% targeted at the Liver.

## The root bark

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
[Mulberry root bark]{style="font-size: 1.2em;"} *sāng bái pí* 桑白皮 *Mori Cortex* [@bensky_chinese_2004, pp. 450] [@chen_chinese_2004, pp. 741]
:::

On the other hand, the root bark is 100% focused on the Lungs. *Sāng bái pí* is commonly used to treat cough and asthma. Its ability to cool and expel phlegm makes it ideal for cough and asthma characterized by thick, viscous sputum, perhaps yellow.

The root bark is also a diuretic, and is used to treat edema, especially that occurring in the face or limbs. It may seem strange that a medicine which targets the Lung would have anything to do with urinary function. There is a saying that "the Lungs are the upper source of water". While urination is primarily the responsibility of the kidneys and urinary bladder, the Lungs provide downward movement in the body, and obstruction of the Lungs can result in urinary difficulty and consequent edema.

## Mulberry Mistletoe

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}

:::

Mistletoe is, of course, an entirely different plant from the mulberry: it is a parasite which lives in and on the mulberry. Never-the-less, its uses are similarly to the uses of the mulberry itself. *Sāng jì shēng* combines the nourishing characteristics of the mulberry fruit with the pain and numbness relieving abilities of the root bark. It is used to treat more advanced conditions of the limb including pain, stiffness, numbness, and atrophy^[Mistletoe also goes to the Kindeys and is commonly used for lumbar pain].

*Sāng jì shēng* has another property which will seem odd to westerners. It is said to "calm the fetus". It is one of about a dozen herbs that are used to treat a range of pregnancy-related issues from morning sickness to bleeding and threatened miscarriage. These herbs are even added to formulas for pregnant women when treating disorders unrelated to the pregnancy. Some, such as the mistletoe, also promote lactation post-partum. Chinese medicine doctors in the USA rarely treat pregnant women due to insurance liability issues, but herbal medicine and acupuncture are very useful in treating many common problems which go along with being pregnant.

## The silkworm

It may come as a surprise, but Chinese Herbal Medicine covers more than just herbs. Beyond the plant kingdom, the *materia medica* includes animals and substances derived from them, fungi, and mineral substances. 

Few plants can claim to have had a greater impact on human history than the mulberry. It is not for its medicinal power, rather the fact that it is the host to the silkworm.

Silk was only produced in China but was strongly desired by Europeans, along with the myriad spices which were only available in Asia. The trade route from China, through the Middle East and on to Europe took its name from its most important commodity and is known as the Silk Road.

:::

This is an example of using both an animal and a fungus. These are silkworms which die after contracting a fungus called "Bombys bassiana*. In Chinese medicine terminolgy, this is considered an invasion of wind pathogen. Similar to what we saw with the mistletoe, despite being an entirely different species, and even a different kingdom, the silkworm works on the Lungs and Liver, where it treats relatively severed conditions of spasms, convulsions, and paralysis. Usually animal substances have stronger effects compared to plants.

As you may recall, the Lungs are responsible for the skin, and while the silkworm does not treat cough, it is commonly used to treat skin itching, rashes, and swelling of the throat, a part of the body belonging to the *Lung system*. Unsurprisingly perhaps, the Lungs control the voice, and this is used to treat loss of voice.

Introducing this herb always got a reaction from my students, ranging from nervous giggles to outright disgust, exacerbated when I told them *cán shā* has a sweet flavor. The Chinese name of this medicinal is quite pleasant, as it translates into English as "silkworm sand".

In keeping with a major theme in the medicinals so far discussed, *cán shā* expels wind and dampness therby treating pain and swelling in the limbs and itchy skin rashes. Unlike the other herbs however, which are cold, *cán shā* is warm. This is an example of how medicinals are chosen based on a range of criteria. Even though this herb and the root bark go to the same parts of the body and focus on the same pathogens, they are not interchangeable, and inappropriate choice due to misdiagnosis can lead to complications.

*Cán shā* is actually more important clinically to treat dampness in a different part of the body. It affects the abdomen and the digestive system (stomach and pancreas^[This organ is, unfortunately, called the Spleen in Chinese medicine.]). Symptoms include severe abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea and cramps.

## Closing thoughts

Chinese herbal medicine is a complex and voluminous topic. It has evolved continuously over two thousand years, refining methods and understanding of the properties of thousands of medicinal substances. I hope that I have given you a flavor (no pun intended) of how herbs are used by doctors of oriental medicine, a way very different from that of western herbalists. 

Always be cautious when taking any herbal medicine. It is a common misconception that taking "nutritional supplements", as herbs are considered in the USA, can't really hurt you, but they can. The person stocking the shelves may not be the best resource for good information, so do your homework.

On the other hand, *sāng shēn*, those delicious purple berries, can be enjoyed by the handful, and make for a delicious jam. Look around your neighborhood, or in green spaces around you. If you find mulberries, pick some and enjoy.
