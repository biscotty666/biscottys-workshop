# Package Management

A typical environment for Data Science projects involves many inter-dependent libraries. Different projects may use different versions of the same library, leading to potential conflict on a given computer. In order to solve this problem, Python uses *virtual environments* to install the necessary packages in an environment isolated from the rest of the system.

Package management in Python is not straight-forward.
