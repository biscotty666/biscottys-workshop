Thanks to Samantha Shanny-Csik [@shanny-csik_creating_2022; @shanny-csik2022] and Albert Rapp [@rapp_ultimate_2022].\n\nI just posted a new (old really) [article](posts/linux/nixos-linux-different/index.qmd) about NixOS. NixOS is not generally understood in the Linux community, but it solves many problems inherent in the traditional Linux system structure. It is my first stab at explaining how NixOS does what it does, and why.\n\n## What's here\n\nIf this is your first time, you can see all the posts [here](posts/posts.qmd), or use the search icon in the upper left. Or just start below.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n### Obsidian\n\n[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is *Personal Knowledge Management* [PKM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) software. If you don't know what Obsidian or PKM are, you could start with [this article](posts/obsidian/optimal-notes-with-obsidian/index.qmd). I have many articles here about advanced usage, taking full advantage of Obsidian's design. [Freeing your thinking](posts/obsidian/freeing-your-thinking.qmd) explains how to move beyond directory structures, taking advantage of the [no-sql](posts/obsidian/obsidian-no-sql-database/index.qmd) nature of Obsidian. There is also a series about the usage of [dataviewjs](posts/obsidian/dataview.qmd), written for non-programmers, to create dashboards and interactive tables.\n\n### Data Science\n\nMy current passion is data science, with particular interest in geospatial analyses (GIS). I enjoy working both in both [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/). Some of articles will explicitly compare the two, as I think that data science Python programmers would find R delightful, such as showing how to do [gps trail mapping](posts/data-science/r-gpx-mapping/trail-mapping-with-r/index.qmd)in R instead of Python.\n\n### Linux\n\nI've used [Linux](https://www.linux.org/) almost exclusively for over three decades. The first 20 years or so I used [Slackware](http://www.slackware.com/), the oldest distribution still being developed. Since then I have extensively used [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/), both mutable and immutable versions, as well as [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) and [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/). \n\nMy current OS of choice is [NixOS](https://nixos.org/), which is unlike any other [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) I'm aware of, and very different conceptually. To get an idea of what I mean, read [The Linux Different](posts/linux/nixos-linux-different/).\n\n\n### Chinese Medicine\n\nI am a retired Doctor of Oriental Medicine, which I practiced for nearly two decades as well as teaching at Southwest Acupuncture College where I specialized in Chinese herbal medicine, medical theory, and diagnosis. I see Chinese herbs all around me when I walk, not to mention those growing in my own yard. Some of these articles will describe the health properties, from a Chinese perspective, of everyday plants.\n\nI also love to cook, and tried to stress food therapy to my patients as a key aspect of healing. Keeping a proper diet is the most important thing that anyone can do for their health. So I will occasionally post recipes, pointing out the health aspects of the meals.\n\n### About me\n\nI have a background ranging from international finance and administration, programming, software translation and localization management. I've been a medical doctor, business owner and professor. You can find out more about me, my current work, and services [here](about.qmd)\n\n:::\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# biscotty's Workshop\n\n> For the love of learning\n\n# Welcome\n\nHere you will find articles about things that interest me.
